      <description>This tutorial will walk you through the basics of writing a Mattermost plugin with a server component.
Note that the steps below are intentionally very manual to explain all of the pieces fitting together. In practice, we recommend referencing mattermost-plugin-starter-template for helpful build scripts. Also, the plugin API changed in Mattermost 5.2. Consult the migration document to upgrade older plugins.
Prerequisites Mattermost plugins extend the server using a Go API. In the future, gRPC may be supported, allowing you to write plugins in any language.</description>

      <description>Plugins are defined by a manifest file and contain at least a server or web app component, or both.
The Plugin Starter Template is a starting point and illustrates the different components of a Mattermost plugin.
A more detailed example is the Demo Plugin, which showcases many of the features of plugins.
Manifest The plugin manifest provides required metadata about the plugin, such as name and ID. It is defined in JSON or YAML.</description>

      <description>First of all, ensure that the following remains exactly the same as in the original mattermost-mobile repo:
 The package ID for the Android app and the Bundle Identifier for the iOS app remain the same as the one in the original mattermost-mobile repo com.mattermost.rnbeta. Android-specific source files remain under android/app/src/main/java/com/mattermost/rnbeta. Your environment variables are set according to your needs.  Install Xcode command line tools: $ xcode-select --install Install Fastlane Fastlane is the easiest way to automate beta deployments and releases for your iOS and Android apps.</description>

      <description>Customizations to the Mattermost Web App can be performed in cases where you need to customize branding, alter localization strings, or fulfill security requirements that are not immediately offered out-of-the-box.
Customization steps With that in mind, customizing and deploying your Mattermost Web App can be done in a few steps:
 Fork the mattermost-webapp repository and then clone your fork in your local environment.  git clone https://github.com/&amp;lt;yourgithubusername&amp;gt;/mattermost-webapp Create a separate branch for your customized version, as it&amp;rsquo;s not recommended to perform them in the master branch (more details about that in the next section regarding rebasing).</description>

      <description>Very good question! Mattermost has many different integration points and this page will help you pick the right one(s) for the job.
I just want to post into Mattermost If you only want to post messages into a Mattermost channel, then all you need is an incoming webhook.
I want to know when someone says something Tracking what gets posted into a channel and receiving real-time events about it can be done using outgoing webhooks.</description>

      <description>This process describes how inactive contributions are managed at Mattermost, inspired by the Kubernetes project:
 After 10 days of inactivity, a contribution becomes stale.   If action is required from submitter, Community Coordinator asks if the team can help clarify previous feedback or provide guidance on next steps, and adds lifecycle/1:stale label to the contribution. If action is required from reviewers, Community Coordinator asks reviewers to share feedback or help answer questions, and adds lifecycle/1:stale label to the contribution.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve made it easy to white label the mobile app and to replace and override the assets used, however, you have to Build Your Own App from Source.
If you look at the Project Directory Structure, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that there is an assets folder containing a base folder with assets provided by Mattermost. These include localization files, images and a release folder that optionally contains the icons and the splash screen of the app when building in release mode.</description>

Solution Make sure the mattermost-redux package is build correctly.
The make build set of commands uses npm ci, sometimes the npm ci command will not run the prepare script used by mattermost-redux thus the library will not built causing the mobile build to fail.
 ssh to the build machine (MacStadium) cd ~/workspace/mm/mattermost-mobile-prod-release/mattermost-mobile rm -rf node_modules npm cache clean --force npm i Finally make sure ls node_modules/mattermost-redux/ shows that mattermost-redux was built.</description>

      <description>Project Structure If you look at the Mattermost Redux repository, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the following folders:
 src contains all source code that is compiled and shipped with the library.  src/actions contains the Redux actions used by the library. Most of the logic that uses the stored data and contacts the server is located here. src/client contains the JavaScript drivers to communicate with the Mattermost server. If you&amp;rsquo;re not wanting to use all of the logic from this library but are instead building your own, this code will be the most useful for you.</description>

      <description>To distribute your Android application via the Google Play Store, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to generate a signed release APK as Android requires all apps to be digitally signed with a certificate before they can be installed.
Generating a Signing Key To generate the signed key, use keytool which comes with the JDK required to develop the Android app.
$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 The above command prompts you for passwords for the keystore and key (make sure you use the same password for both), and asks you to provide the Distinguished Name fields for your key.</description>

      <description>Similar to other frameworks like Flux, actions in Redux represent a single change to the Redux store as a plain JavaScript object.
{ type: &amp;#39;SELECT_CHANNEL&amp;#39;, data: channelId } They are created by functions called action creators. In regular Redux, this function will take some arguments and return an action representing how the store should be changed. Something to note with Mattermost Redux is that we typically refer to the action creators as the &amp;ldquo;actions&amp;rdquo; themselves since there&amp;rsquo;s often a single action creator for a given type of action.</description>

      <description>This page describes how to build a new React component in the Mattermost webapp. A new component must meet the following requirements:
 Is pure, meaning that all information required to render is passed in by props. Has no direct store interaction. Use a container to wrap the component if needed. Has component tests. Is generic and re-usable when possible. Has documented props.  If none of those make any sense to you or you&amp;rsquo;re new to React and Redux, then check out these links:</description>

      <description>The REST API is a JSON web service that facilitates communication between Mattermost clients, as well as integrations, and the server.
The server is currently on API version 4.
Reference Looking for the API reference? That can be found here: https://api.mattermost.com.
Adding an Endpoint To add an endpoint to API version 4, each item on the following checklist must be completed:
 Document the endpoint Implement the API handler on the server Add a function to the Go driver Write a unit test Submit your implementation!</description>

      <description>Adding fields to the configuration In order to add fields to the configuration, you need to modify model/config.go in the server by adding the desired field to one of the structs such as ServiceSettings and setting its default value in the corresponding SetDefaults method.
Exposing settings in the System Console To expose the newly-added field in the System Console, you need to add that same setting to the AdminDefinition JS object in mattermost-webapp/components/admin_console/admin_definition.</description>

      <description>The Mattermost server uses go modules to manage dependencies. To manage dependencies you must have modules enabled.
Enabling go modules support (Do this first!) While golang migrates to support go modules, you need to set the environment variable GO111MODULE to on if you are developing in the GOPATH. For example:
export GO111MODULE=on Once this is done, all go commands issued will use the modules system.
Adding or updating a new dependency Be sure you have enabled go modules support.</description>

      <description>Mattermost provides a CLI (command-line interface) to administer and handle specific administrative tasks.
Understanding the CLI The CLI interface is written in Cobra, a powerful and modern CLI creation library. If you have never used Cobra before, it is well documented in its GitHub Repository.
The source code used to build our CLI interface is written in the cmd/mattermost directory of the mattermost-server repository.
Each &amp;ldquo;command&amp;rdquo; of the CLI is stored in a different file of the cmd/mattermost/commands directory.</description>

      <description>Apple requires all apps to be digitally signed with a certificate before they can be installed, so to distribute your iOS application via Apple App Store, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to generate a signed release IPA. The process is the same as any other native iOS app, but in our case we&amp;rsquo;ve created a set of scripts in conjunction with Fastlane to make this process easier than the standard manual process.
We make use of Match to sync your provisioning profiles (the profiles will be created for you if needed), then use Gym to build and sign the app, and then optionally use Pilot to submit the app to TestFlight in order for you to promote the app to the App Store.</description>

      <description>Mattermost supports plugins that offer powerful features for extending and deeply integrating with both the server and web/desktop apps.
This document covers the plugin infrastructure and how to contribute to it.
Building Plugins Looking to build a plugin? Then you want the plugin author documentation.
Overview Plugins are generally made of at least two parts: a manifest and a server binary and/or a JavaScript bundle.
The manifest tells Mattermost what the plugin is and provides a set of metadata used by the server to install and run the plugin.</description>

      <description>Reducers in Redux are pure functions that describe how the data in the store changes after any given action. A reducer receives the previous state of the store and an action as a JavaScript object (see here for more information on actions) and should output the resulting state without receiving any outside data. Because reducers are pure, they will always produce the same resulting state for a given state and action.</description>

      <description>Selectors are functions used to compute data from the data in the Redux stores. This is done using Reselect, a library designed to do this efficiently by memoizing any results so that they are only recalculated if relevant parts of the store change. The code for this is in the src/selectors folder of the Mattermost Redux repository.

      <description>Using Redux with React is fairly straightforward thanks to the React Redux library. It provides the connect function to create higher order components that have access to the Redux store to set their props.
A typical Redux-connected component will be in its own folder with two files: index.jsx containing the code to connect to the Redux store and the file where the component is actually implemented. This helps to keep the Redux logic separate from the rendering for the component which keeps it more easily readable and makes it easier to test since it can be done without the whole Redux store.</description>

      <description>The Mattermost web app is going through a big restructuring effort to move from using Flux to Redux. When we first started building the webapp, React was still new to the world, and so were the frameworks and design patterns. As a result, the webapp has had a lot of organic growth over the last couple of years, and is using an assortment of different design patterns.
This campaign is meant to help with that by moving app state and logic into our Redux repository, and by migrating the webapp components to be pure and use Redux to supply their props.</description>

      <description>The Mattermost team wants to proactively improve the quality, security, and stability of the code, and one way to do this is by introducing the usage of type checking. Thus, we have decided to introduce Typescript in our codebase as it&amp;rsquo;s a mature and feature-rich approach.
As a first step, we have migrated the mattermost-redux library to use Typescript, and are now in the process of migrating the webapp to use Typescript.</description>

      <description>The plugin manifest defines the metadata required to load and present your plugin. The manifest file should be named plugin.json or plugin.yaml and placed in the top of your plugin bundle.  Example plugin.json: { &amp;#34;id&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;com.mycompany.myplugin&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;My Plugin&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;description&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;This is my plugin&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;homepage_url&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;https://example.com&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;support_url&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;https://example.com/support&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;release_notes_url&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;https://example.com/releases/v0.0.1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;icon_path&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;assets/logo.svg&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;version&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;0.1.0&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;min_server_version&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;5.6.0&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;server&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;executables&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;linux-amd64&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;server/dist/plugin-linux-amd64&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;darwin-amd64&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;server/dist/plugin-darwin-amd64&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;windows-amd64&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;server/dist/plugin-windows-amd64.exe&amp;#34; } }, &amp;#34;webapp&amp;#34;: { &amp;#34;bundle_path&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;webapp/dist/main.</description>

      <description>When an employee leaves the company, any credentials they had should be revoked. The more things they had access to, the harder this is, so when onboarding, it&amp;rsquo;s important to give them only the necessary privileges. It&amp;rsquo;s also important to avoid shared secrets that cannot be revoked from one person.
The following is a list of things to do. It should be kept as complete and up-to-date as possible, but treated as non-comprehensive when offboarding someone.</description>

      <description>Vault is a high security secret store. At Mattermost, its primary purpose is to sign SSH keys.
Installation If you&amp;rsquo;re on macOS and have Brew installed, you can just brew install vault. Otherwise, see the Vault installation instructions.
Once installed, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to configure it. Add the following to your .bash_profile or .zshrc:
export VAULT_ADDR=&#39;https://vault.internal.mattermost.com:8200&#39; Authenticating Authentication is done via OneLogin and RADIUS:
$ vault login -method=radius username=your_username@mattermost.com OneLogin users must have the &amp;ldquo;Developers&amp;rdquo; role in order to authenticate.</description>

      <description>There are a couple of slash-commands available on GitHub which are implemented via Mattermod. They only work on PRs.
The commands are:
 /cherry-pick $BRANCH_NAME, e.g. /cherry-pick release-5.10: Opens a PR to cherry pick a change into the branch $BRANCH_NAME. This command only works for the submitter of the PR and members of the Mattermost organization. /check-cla: Checks if the PR contributor has signed the CLA. /autoassign: Automatically assigns reviewers to a PR.</description>

Accessing AWS You can sign into the web console for the master AWS account at this URL:
https://mattermost.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
After signing into the master account, you can access other accounts within the organization through role switching. This can be done from the dropdown on the right side of the console&amp;rsquo;s menu bar, or you can use this link to switch to the developer account:</description>

      <description>Generating AWS Keys using OneLogin authentication We use https://github.com/physera/onelogin-aws-cli to generate temporary AWS keys.
Installation To install, use pip:
$ pip install onelogin-aws-cli Note that onelogin-aws-cli requires Python 3. It is not recommended to install Python packages globally on your system.
Usage Running onelogin-aws-login will perform the authentication against OneLogin, and cache the credentials in the AWS CLI Shared Credentials File.
For every required piece of information, the program will present interactive inputs, unless that value has already been provided through either command line parameters, environment variables, or configuration file directives.</description>

      <description>Migrating Plugins from Mattermost 5.5 and earlier The plugin package exposed by Mattermost 5.6 and later drops support for automatically unmarshalling a plugin&amp;rsquo;s configuration onto the struct embedding MattermostPlugin. As server plugins are inherently concurrent (hooks being called asynchronously) and the plugin configuration can change at any time, access to the configuration must be synchronized.
Plugins compiled against 5.5 and earlier will continue to work without modification, automatically unmarshalling a plugin&amp;rsquo;s configuration but with the existing risk of a corrupted read or write.</description>

      <description>Mattermost Enterprise Edition servers with an E20 license have the ability to run in High Availability (HA) mode, meaning a cluster of Mattermost app servers running together as a single Mattermost deployment.
It is important that all plugins consider HA environments when being built.
Plugins are started as subprocesses of the main Mattermost process on each app server. This means a Mattermost deployment that has three app servers will have three separate copies of the same plugin running.</description>

The Plugin Marketplace is a platform that supports discovery, installation and updates of plugins directly within Mattermost. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to get feedback on your plugin and help make it more popular. Once your plugin is accepted to the Marketplace, Mattermost will also send you swag!
Requirements for Adding A Community Plugin to the Marketplace Every community plugin must fulfill the following checklist to be added to the Marketplace:</description>

      <description>See here for server-specific best practices for plugins. Webapp-specific best practices are incoming.
How can a plugin enable its configuration through the System Console? Once a plugin is installed, Administrators have access to the plugin&amp;rsquo;s configuration page in the System Console &amp;gt; Plugins section. The configurable settings must first be defined in the plugin&amp;rsquo;s manifest setting schema. The web app supports several basic pre-defined settings type, e.g. bool and dropdown, for which the corresponding UI components are provided in order to complete configuration in the System Console.</description>

      <description>The plugin architecture consists of an API, hooks, and plugin helpers.
When a plugin invokes an API method, it makes an RPC call to the Mattermost server and waits for a response. When the Mattermost server invokes a hook method, it makes an RPC call to the plugin and waits for a response:
// OnActivate is a hook called by the server when the plugin is started. func (p *Plugin) OnActivate() error { // CreatePost is an API called by the plugin to create a post.</description>

Developers and PMs decide when to create the release branch. The branch can be created from master or from an existing release branch, depending on which type of release we are planning. If it is a Quality Release, the new branch should be branched off the previous release, otherwise the branch should be off the master branch.</description>

      <description>All new infrastructure should meet these requirements. Authentication should be centralized. OneLogin, LDAP, IAM Groups, GitHub, or even Mattermost should define the level of access granted to a person. We want to minimize the number of steps required to onboard or offboard new team members and don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to grant or revoke access service-by-service.
For example, new machines in AWS should be created without a keypair and use Vault+OneLogin to control SSH access.</description>

      <description>Usually organizations use an internal network to prevent unauthorized people from connecting to their private network and by using their own network infrastructure/connectivity they can maintain their desirable level of security for their data. But it would be convenient for users to connect to that private network while they are away from the office&amp;rsquo;s building, on their own internet connection. To solve that problem, VPN (Virtual Private Network) is used to allow authorized remote access to an organization&amp;rsquo;s private network.</description>

      <description>What is distributed tracing? Large-scale cloud applications are usually built using interconnected services that can be rather hard to troubleshoot. When a service is scaled, simple logging doesn&amp;rsquo;t cut it anymore and a more in-depth view into system&amp;rsquo;s flow is required. That&amp;rsquo;s where distributed tracing comes into play; it allows developers and SREs to get a detailed view of a request as it travels through the system of services. With distributed tracing you can:</description>

      <description>In Linux, system calls (syscalls) are at the heart of everything. They are the primary interface through which an application interacts with the kernel. Therefore, it is vital that they are fast. And especially in a post-Spectre/Meltdown world, this is all the more important.
A major chunk of the syscalls deal with I/O, because that&amp;rsquo;s what most applications do. For network I/O, we&amp;rsquo;ve had the epoll family of syscalls which have provided us with reasonably fast performance.</description>

      <description>On Monday, March 16, 2020, I had the privilege to (virtually) join Shota Gvinepadze and his students at the Free University of Tbilisi and speak about &amp;ldquo;Advanced Git @ Mattermost&amp;rdquo; for a portion of their class time.
The following are my speaking notes from the session, slightly modified from the original slides for this format. Keep in mind that the command line examples are illustrative of my workflow, and not meant to be run in isolation.</description>

      <description>In person, you can easily tell someone&amp;rsquo;s mood based on their body language and how they speak, but that&amp;rsquo;s much more difficult with text alone. Emojis are a great way to add tone to a piece of text and also help make text-based conversation feel more casual, relaxed, and fun. Thanks to emojis, we can chat with much more real emotion than you might get by being careful about your word choice or by including just the right number of exclamation marks and periods at the end of a sentence.</description>

      <description>Maintaining success in a large open-source project is one of the key objectives of Mattermost. We have hundreds of contributors and we want to create a project that could serve as a model in the Go community. Having said that, following idiomatic Go principles is the thing that we care most about while maintaining our code consistency. For this specific task, we utilized go vet and with this blog post, I would like to explain how we pushed the limits of this tool by extending it.</description>

      <description>Welcome! This is the second part of our AST blog post series, expanding on the subject of utilizing Go AST libraries to automate and improve your workflow.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss a rather common problem that comes up while working with Go code and the way we&amp;rsquo;ve solved it by sprinkling a little bit of AST magic dust. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.
Problem: A struct with no interface Let&amp;rsquo;s say you are working on a large code base that was not built with interfaces in mind, meaning, there are structs and methods attached to those structs, but there is no interface describing it.</description>

      <description>One of the most important parts of the Mattermost source code is the one responsible for accessing the Mattermost database - the store. Every single database access is handled by the store, so we needed to find a way to extend its functionality while introducing as little complexity as possible. This is the reason behind the current layered approach using struct embedding.
Our store is responsible for storing and retrieving data, and sometimes we need to add functionality that is not strictly related to the database queries, for example, cache data or add instrumentation.</description>

      <description>At Mattermost, we have traditionally relied on the trusty go vet and gofmt checks for our CI runs. Although it works well, there are a lot of other powerful linters out there which we&amp;rsquo;re potentially missing out on.
Speaking of linters, the first name that inevitably comes up is staticcheck. It&amp;rsquo;s a powerful metalinter with a whole slew of checks. But simply running staticcheck is not sufficient, because it misses out on other linters which perform a single task, but nevertheless are very powerful.</description>

      <description>With the upgrade to React Native 61 came the prospect of substantially improving performance of our Android app. How? Through the use of Hermes, Facebook’s new JavaScript engine. To say that we were excited is an understatement. And with that excitement came curiosity: how is this new JavaScript engine achieving performance boosts?
Let’s first chat a bit about JS engines in general.
How does your JavaScript code eventually get executed by the CPU on the machine?</description>

      <description>I recently joined Mattermost as a Remote Software Engineer and while I’ve worked in remote environments before, I was really surprised at how amazing this company is to work with. During my onboarding I discovered that they have really developed a culture built around being remote; one that allowed for me to feel as part of a larger team and always engaged, rather than separated from my peers and working alone.</description>

      <description>It wasn’t my first time flying. It also wasn’t the first time I had arrived at the airport early enough to require multiple cups of coffee. As I sat at my gate, however, I did find myself wondering for the first time: had I ever heard the words “Lambda,” “stateful set&amp;rdquo;, and “yaml” while waiting to board?
You see, a bunch of us were coming from all over to attend KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2019.</description>

      <description>Monitoring the state of your clusters is an effective way to discover bottlenecks in your multi-cluster production environment. It is one of the key challenges that development teams are facing and factors such as the team experience as well as the number and distribution of the applications can make things even more complex.
Better monitoring can help identify single points of failure. Being able to get information about things like the number of applications running on each node or the CPU and memory performance can help to get closer to zero downtime deployments.</description>

      <description>Matterpoll is a plugin that allows users to create polls in Mattermost. Since Mattermost is localized in 16 different languages, it’s optimal that Matterpoll is similarly localized.
Because we rely on contributors to do the translations, we want to make it easy for them to translate new strings and determine whether already translated strings need to be updated because the &amp;ldquo;source&amp;rdquo; text changed. On the other hand, Matterpoll only has two maintainers (@kaakaa and me) and no infrastructure of its own to work with.</description>

      <description>Mattermost is starting a new Open Source campaign, this time around increasing the unit test coverage for the mmctl tool.
The mmctl tool is a CLI application that mimics the commands and features of the current Mattermost CLI tool and uses the Mattermost REST API to communicate with the server. Using the tool, you can control and manage several Mattermost servers without having to access the specific machine on which the server is running.</description>

Instrumenting your API handler in Go is very straightforward - setup a connection to a collection server supporting the OpenTracing spec (we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to use Jaeger) and wrap your code in spans.</description>

 This comment on a pull request is crushing. After all the effort you&amp;rsquo;ve spent writing your code, adding new unit tests, and rebasing your changes to make each commit almost a work of art: how could your tests possibly be failing?
Begrudgingly, you sign into your CI server only to realize the failing tests have nothing to do with your code. You think, &amp;ldquo;Hmm, maybe the code is more coupled than I expected.</description>

The goal was to ease onboarding by automatically adding group members to configured teams and channels.
With the upcoming Mattermost v5.12 we&amp;rsquo;re adding the ability to create teams and channels that are only accessible to those synced groups. This post describes what LDAP &amp;ldquo;nested groups&amp;rdquo; are and how we ended up modelling and representing them in code.</description>

There were plenty of interesting talks, but this post focuses on a talk by Zhiniang Peng and Minrui Yang on the dangers of homomorphic encryption. This post gives a high level overview and avoids giving too much technical detail.
What is Homomorphic Encryption? Homomorphic encryption is defined as an encryption scheme which allows computations to be performed on ciphertext that, when decrypted, match the result of the operation as if it was applied to the plain text.</description>

      <description>Go is an extremely opinionated programming language. import something in a file that&amp;rsquo;s not used? It won&amp;rsquo;t compile, and there&amp;rsquo;s no flag to override. While there are workarounds, the end result remains the same: Go files are never cluttered by unused imports. This is true for all Go code everywhere, making every Go project more accessible.
Not all Go opinions are enforced by the compiler. Some are documented in Effective Go, and yet others are reflected only in the coding style of the Go standard library.</description>

This allows Mattermost to be exposed at something like https://example.com/company/mattermost, with your proxy server exposing different services at other subpaths. Subpath support is configured via the Site URL.
Using subpaths in production In production, after configuration and restart, the application server expects all HTTP requests to be anchored to the configured subpath. This includes static assets, API calls, and WebSockets. For convenience, the application server redirects any unexpected requests back into this subpath, e.</description>

      <description>A reminder that Mattermost will be separating the /platform repo into two repositories on September 6th, 2017:
 a new repository for webapp client code, hosted at github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp existing repository (/platform) renamed to /mattermost-server, containing the server code.  Why the change? Separates PRs for client and server with better naming conventions. This is similar to React Native and Redux repositories and helps us:

      <description>This is an unofficial guide. Community testing, feedback, and improvements are welcome and greatly appreciated.
  Install the Windows Subsystem for Linux: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10.
Note: Docker for Windows expects path to have the format /c/foo/bar, but WSL uses /mnt/c/foo/bar instead.
Run winver and check which version of Windows you have. If you are using 1803 or higher, then you need to create a file /etc/wsl.conf with the following content to make sure your drives are mounted at the root rather than inside /mnt:</description>

      <description>Install and setup Docker.
 If you are using Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise, you can use Docker for Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/ For other Windows versions, or if you prefer to use VirtualBox, use Docker Toolbox: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/  Note: MM-9791 introduced using docker-compose to manage containers. To preserve your data on upgrade, execute the following steps.
First, backup from any existing containers:
mysqldump -h 127.0.0.1 --column-statistics=0 -u mmuser -p mattermost_test &amp;gt; mm_mysql_backup.</description>

      <description>Plugins communicate with the main Mattermost server by RPC. In order to debug them with Delve, a few steps are necessary.
MacOS  After starting the main Mattermost application, run ps aux | grep name.of.your.plugin. This will print a list of running processes that match that name, as such: username 78836 0.0 0.1 4397696 12492 s006 S 7:07AM 0:00.03 plugins/name.of.your.plugin/server/dist/plugin-darwin-amd64. Grab the pid, which is the second number after your username in the output above.</description>

      <description>How should plugins serve publicly available static files? Add all static files under a file directory named public within the plugin directory, and include the files in the plugin bundle using the Makefile.
How can plugins make sure http requests are authentic? Plugins can implement the ServeHTTP to listen to http requests. This can e.g. be used to receive post action requests when Interactive Messages Buttons and Menus are triggered by users.</description>

      <description>Actions that apply to specific Channels  Recommendation: Have your plugin register the actions to the channel header. This makes it quickly accessible for users and the actions apply on the channel they&amp;rsquo;re viewing. Example: Zoom meeting posts to a channel  You can additionally register a slash command on the server-side to take channel-specific actions.
 Example: Jira project actions  Actions that apply to specific messages  Recommendation: Have your plugin register a post dropdown menu component with some text, icon and an action function.</description>
