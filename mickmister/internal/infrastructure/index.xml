      <description>Community Grafana The Grafana application is used to visualise the performance metrics of the community installations. The application runs in the Mattermost Cloud infrastructure in the same cluster that community installations are hosted.
Grafana URL: https://grafana.mattermost.com
How to create and use the variable that enables selection between installations To get the different versions of installations in a simple variable, a variable of type query needs to be created with a query value of label_values(v1alpha1_mattermost_com_installation).</description>

      <description>Vault is a high security secret store. At Mattermost, its primary purpose is to sign SSH keys.
Installation If you&amp;rsquo;re on macOS and have Brew installed, you can just brew install vault. Otherwise, see the Vault installation instructions.
Once installed, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to configure it. Add the following to your .bash_profile or .zshrc:
export VAULT_ADDR=&#39;https://vault.internal.mattermost.com:8200&#39; Authenticating Authentication is done via OneLogin and RADIUS:
$ vault login -method=radius username=your_username@mattermost.com OneLogin users must have the &amp;ldquo;Developers&amp;rdquo; role in order to authenticate.</description>

      <description>Most of our infrastructure is hosted in AWS.
Accessing AWS You can sign into the web console for the master AWS account at this URL:
https://mattermost.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
After signing into the master account, you can access other accounts within the organization through role switching. This can be done from the dropdown on the right side of the console&amp;rsquo;s menu bar, or you can use this link to switch to the developer account:</description>

      <description>Generating AWS Keys using OneLogin authentication We use https://github.com/physera/onelogin-aws-cli to generate temporary AWS keys.
Installation To install, use pip:
$ pip install onelogin-aws-cli Note that onelogin-aws-cliÂ requires Python 3. It is not recommended to install Python packages globally on your system.
Usage Running onelogin-aws-login will perform the authentication against OneLogin, and cache the credentials in the AWS CLI Shared Credentials File.
For every required piece of information, the program will present interactive inputs, unless that value has already been provided through either command line parameters, environment variables, or configuration file directives.</description>

      <description>Jenkins build.mattermost.com Most of our automated builds currently take place on Jenkins at build.mattermost.com.
Updating Go Builds on this Jenkins installation use a globally installed Golang distribution. To update it, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to access the master instance and all of its slaves. Make sure the machine isn&amp;rsquo;t in use, then run the following (replacing &amp;ldquo;1.9.2 &amp;rdquo; with the desired Go version):
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.9.2 .linux-amd64.tar.gz sudo su rm -r /usr/local/go/ tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.</description>

      <title>Guidelines for New Infrastructure</title>

      <guid>/internal/infrastructure/guidelines/</guid>
      <description>All new infrastructure should meet these requirements. Authentication should be centralized. OneLogin, LDAP, IAM Groups, GitHub, or even Mattermost should define the level of access granted to a person. We want to minimize the number of steps required to onboard or offboard new team members and don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to grant or revoke access service-by-service.
For example, new machines in AWS should be created without a keypair and use Vault+OneLogin to control SSH access.</description>
