      <description>Receiving mobile push notification if the use of a corporate proxy server is required by your IT policy When your IT policy requires a corporate proxy to scan and audit all outbound traffic the following options are available:
1 - Deploy Mattermost with connection restricted post-proxy relay in DMZ or a trusted cloud environment Some legacy corporate proxy configurations may be incompatible with the requirements of modern mobile architectures, such as the requirement of HTTP/2 requests from Apple to send push notifications to iOS devices.</description>

      <description>As of April 10, 2018, Google has deprecated the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service. The GCM server and client APIs are deprecated and will be removed as of April 11, 2019. Migrate GCM apps to Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), which inherits the reliable and scalable GCM infrastructure, plus many new features.
The Mattermost Push Notification Service version 5.8+ uses FCM to send Push notifications for Android.
  Upgrade your Mattermost Push Notification service to version 5.</description>
