      <description>Developer Tools The electron app itself can be inspected using the developer tools, available from the View menu:
However, this view does not expose the contents of the webviews for inspection. To open the developer tools for a webview, first access the console for the electron shell as above, and then run
document.getElementById(&amp;#34;mattermostView0&amp;#34;).openDevTools(); Use mattermostView0 to inspect the first opened tab, mattermostView1 to inspect the second opened tab, and so on.</description>

The signing procedure varies depending on the platform that the release is destined for and the platform that the signing operation is performed on. This page attempts to document the procedure and some common pitfalls that developers may encounter along the way.</description>
