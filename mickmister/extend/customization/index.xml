      <description>Customizations to the Mattermost Web App can be performed in cases where you need to customize branding, alter localization strings, or fulfill security requirements that are not immediately offered out-of-the-box.
Customization steps With that in mind, customizing and deploying your Mattermost Web App can be done in a few steps:
 Fork the mattermost-webapp repository and then clone your fork in your local environment.  git clone https://github.com/&amp;lt;yourgithubusername&amp;gt;/mattermost-webapp Create a separate branch for your customized version, as it&amp;rsquo;s not recommended to perform them in the master branch (more details about that in the next section regarding rebasing).</description>
